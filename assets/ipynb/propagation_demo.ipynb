    "\n",
    "- We maintain `max_row[g]`: the *maximum reachable row* for a golem/component.\n",
    "- **Step 1 (Seed Maximization):** If the current golem's exit touches a neighbor's **body**, inherit that neighbor's `max_row` as the initial **seed** (i.e., start as large as possible).\n",
    "- **Step 2 (BFS Propagation):** Traverse **exit-to-exit** connections (which may include diagonals), and propagate the value to the whole connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this two-step design?\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** If a newly placed golem is already adjacent to a fully computed component, it should **immediately** inherit that component's max value.\n",
    "- **Efficiency & Simplicity:** With a large seed, a single BFS pass (enqueue only on improvement) is enough. Without it, you may need repeated re-queuing or you might fail to update at all.\n"
